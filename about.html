    <h3>So why does it exist, anyways?</h3>
    <p>Amazing question, I would've asked the same thing. This website exists
      because Waylon, or "Wayy" was doing <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" style="color: inherit;">The Odin Project</a>
      and this was one of their projects that was "required" to continue the curriculum.
      This website is much more than they wanted it to be, but hey, its fun to add to this
      website as I go!
    </p>
    <h3>Who is this Wayy guy, anyways, and why does he sound so dumb</h3>
    <p>
      Wow, screw you too, me. Wayy is just some guy doing The Odin Project because
      he's scared of growing up into a job that he doesnt enjoy.

    <h3>What is the meaning of life</h3>
    <p>
      This question doesnt belong on the about page of a shitty cooking website. For more see:
